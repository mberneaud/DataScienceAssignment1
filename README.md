# Content of the repo
We have worked on two different datasets. The _LifeCycleSavings_ data set on the savings ratio from 1960 to 1970, and the _Orange_ data set which contains data on the growth of Orange trees. Analyses of the two different data sets is done in two respective folders, named [JonasFiles](./JonasFiles) which contains the analysis of life cycle savings data and [Orange](./Orange), which contains the analysis of Orange tree data.
